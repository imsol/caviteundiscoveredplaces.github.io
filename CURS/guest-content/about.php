      <p style="font-size: 15px; text-align: center; color: white">   a province in the Philippines located on the southern shores of Manila Bay in the Calabarzon region on Luzon island. Situated just 21 <br> kilometers (13 mi) south of the capital, it is one of the most industrialized and fastest growing provinces because of its close proximity to <br>Metro Manila. With a population of 3,678,301 in 2015, it is the most populated province in the country. <br>
        For over 300 years, the province played an important role in both the country's colonial past and eventual fight for independence, earning it the title "Historical Capital of the Philippines". <br> It became the cradle of the Philippine Revolution, <br>which led to the renouncement of Spanish colonial control, finally culminating in the Philippine Declaration of Independence on June 12, 1898 in Kawit, Cavite. <br> The old provincial capital, Cavite City also hosted docks for the Manila galleon, <br> becoming an essential part of commerce between Asia and the New World.</p>
